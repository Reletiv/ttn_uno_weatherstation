# weatherstation
Arduino LoRa weatherstation

This project uses a The Things UNO to connect to The Things Network.

This weather station sends Temperature, Humidity, and battery voltage to The Things Network every +/-5 minutes
it uses a BME280 for the data and Arduino's internal reference for measuring battery voltage.
